# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up the VNC viewer, raspberry pi, and running my first model on VNC viewer. In order to run my first model, I had to set up tensorflow lite, a smaller version of tensorflow. Even though those two softwares were relatively similar, I had to adjust a lot of the applications towards tensorflow lite since raspberry pi no longer supports tensorflow. This gave me a lot of trouble setting up the first model but I succeeded. I took a pretrained model that was available from tensorflow.org and downloaded/imported the files into my VNC viewer. I also had to adjust code in the given pretrained model since it was adapted to tensorflow instead of tensorflow lite. As this was a pretrained model, the outputs were already predetermined but it marked the success and functionality of my application. I had many struggles during this time as all of these were new concepts to me but I had developed a working prototype.
