# Raspberry Pi Image Recognition
This application uses AI, or machine learning, and tensorflow lite along with neural networks to categorize and/or classify any given image.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone

My second milestone was creating my first custom model. I downloaded different softwares to create the environment for my custom model to be coded, trained, and executed. The model that I created was classifying whether the image was a fruit or a vegetable. During this milestone, I also created a fruit classification model which could tell what type of fruit the given image was. Even though these were two seperate models, they both had the same concepts which interwined that helped me develop both of these models. I had a lot of trouble during this milestone, for example: setting up the environment, importing libraries and files, as well as some syntax errors. Also, I used tensorflow to develop both of these models as I had trouble running tensorflow lite. I plan to transfer these models into tensorflow lite which then I can use it in the VNC viewer.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up the VNC viewer, raspberry pi, and running my first model on VNC viewer. In order to run my first model, I had to set up tensorflow lite, a smaller version of tensorflow. Even though those two softwares were relatively similar, I had to adjust a lot of the applications towards tensorflow lite since raspberry pi no longer supports tensorflow. This gave me a lot of trouble setting up the first model but I succeeded. I took a pretrained model that was available from tensorflow.org and downloaded/imported the files into my VNC viewer. I also had to adjust code in the given pretrained model since it was adapted to tensorflow instead of tensorflow lite. As this was a pretrained model, the outputs were already predetermined but it marked the success and functionality of my application. I had many struggles during this time as all of these were new concepts to me but I had developed a working prototype.
